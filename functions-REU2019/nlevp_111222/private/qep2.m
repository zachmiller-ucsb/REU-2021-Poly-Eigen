function [coeffs,fun,sol] = qep2
%QEP2  3-by-3 QEP with known, nontrivial Jordan structure.
%  [COEFFS,FUN,SOL] = nlevp('qep2') generates a 3-by-3 quadratic matrix
%  polynomial Q(lambda) = lambda^2*A2 + lambda*A1 + A0
%  for which the complete eigensystem is known.
%  The matrices are returned in a cell array: COEFFS = {A_0,A_1,A_2}.
%  FUN is a function handle to evaluate the monomials 1,lambda,lambda^2
%  and their derivatives.
%  The exact eigenvalues (namely -1, 1, 1, 1, inf, inf) and correspomnding
%  Jordan chains are known and are returned in SOL.EVAL and SOL.EVEC.
%  This problem has the properties pep, qep, real, solution.
