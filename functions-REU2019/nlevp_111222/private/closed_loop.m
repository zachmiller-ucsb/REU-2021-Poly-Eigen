%CLOSED_LOOP  2-by-2 QEP associated with closed-loop control system.
%  [COEFFS,FUN] = nlevp('closed_loop',ALPHA) constructs a 2-by-2 quadratic
%  matrix polynomial lambda^2*A2 + lambda*A1 + A0 associated with a
%  closed-loop control system with feedback gains 1 and 1 + ALPHA.
%  For 0 < ALPHA < 0.875 all eigenvalues lie inside the unit disc.
%  The default is ALPHA = 1. The matrices are returned in a cell array:
%  COEFFS = {A0, A1, A2}.
%  FUN is a function handle to evaluate the monomials 1,lambda,lambda^2
%  and their derivatives.
%  This problem has the properties pep, qep, real, parameter_dependent.
