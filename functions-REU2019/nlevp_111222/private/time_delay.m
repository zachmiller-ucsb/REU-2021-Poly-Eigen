function [coeffs,fun] = time_delay
%TIME_DELAY    3-by-3 NEP from time-delay system.
%   [COEFFS,FUN] = nlevp('time_delay',N,KAPPA,m) generates a 3-by-3
%   nonlinear matrix function -lambda*EYE(3) + A_0 + A_1*exp(-lambda)
%   that is the charcteristic equation of a time-delay system with a
%   single delay and constant coefficents.
%   The problem has a double non-semisimple eigenvalue lambda = 3*PI*i.
%   The matrices are returned in a cell array: COEFFS = {EYE(3), A_0, A_1}.
%   FUN is a function handle to evaluate the functions -lambda, 1, and
%   exp(-lambda) and their derivatives.
%   This problem has the properties nep, real.

%   A typo in coefficient b(2) has been corrected as in Jarlebring and
%   Michiels (2011).
