function [coeffs,fun] = cd_player
%CD_PLAYER      QEP from model of CD player.
%  [COEFFS,FUN] = nlevp('cd_player') constructs a 60-by-60 quadratic matrix
%  polynomial lambda^2*M + lambda*D + K arising in the
%  study of a CD player control task.
%  The matrices are returned in a cell array: COEFFS = {K, D, M}.
%  FUN is a function handle to evaluate the monomials 1,lambda,lambda^2
%  and their derivatives.
%  This problem has the properties pep, qep, real.
