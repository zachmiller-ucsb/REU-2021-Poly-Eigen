function [coeffs,fun] = wing
%WING     3-by-3 QEP from analysis of oscillations of a wing in an airstream.
%  [COEFFS,FUN] = nlevp('wing') generates a 3-by-3 quadratic matrix
%  polynomial Q(lambda) = lambda^2*A2 + lambda*A1 + A0 arising from
%  the analysis of the oscillations of a wing in an airstream.
%  The matrices are returned in a cell array: COEFFS = {A0, A1, A2}.
%  FUN is a function handle to evaluate the monomials 1,lambda,lambda^2,
%  and their derivatives.
%  This problem has the properties pep, qep, real.
