function [coeffs,fun] = qep5
%QEP5  3-by-3 nonregular QEP with known Smith form.
%  [COEFFS,FUN,SOL] = nlevp('qep5') generates a 3-by-3 quadratic matrix
%  polynomial Q(lambda) = lambda^2*A2 + lambda*A1 + A0.
%  Q has Smith form diag(1,lambda-1,0).
%  The matrices are returned in a cell array: COEFFS = {A_0,A_1,A_2}.
%  FUN is a function handle to evaluate the monomials 1,lambda,lambda^2
%  and their derivatives.
%  This problem has the properties pep, qep, nonregular, real.
