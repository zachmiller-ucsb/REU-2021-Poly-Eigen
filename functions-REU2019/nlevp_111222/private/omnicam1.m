function [coeffs,fun] = omnicam1
%OMNICAM1  9-by-9 QEP from model of omnidirectional camera.
%  [COEFFS,FUN] = nlevp('omnicam1') generates a 9-by-9 quadratic matrix 
%  polynomial Q(lambda) = lambda^2*A2 + lambda*A1 + A0 arising from a
%  model of an omnidirectional camera (one with angle of view greater
%  than 180 degrees).
%  A0 has rank 1, A2 has rank 5, and A1 has full rank,
%  in each case the rank being the number of nonzero columns.
%  The matrices are returned in a cell array: COEFFS = {A0, A1, A2}.
%  FUN is a function handle to evaluate the monomials 1,lambda,lambda^2
%  and their derivatives.
%  This problem has the properties pep, qep, real.
