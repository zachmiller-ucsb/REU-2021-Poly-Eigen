function [coeffs,fun] = foundation
%FOUNDATION  Sparse QEP from model of machine foundations.
%  [COEFFS,FUN] = nlevp('foundation' generates the coefficient matrices of
%  a quadratic matrix polynomial lambda^2*C + lambda*B + A arising in a
%  model of reinforced concrete machine foundations resting on the ground.
%  The model includes hysteretic damping.
%  This problem is complex symmetric and has dimension 3627.
%  The matrices are sparse and returned in a
%  cell array: COEFFS = {A, B, C}.
%  FUN is a function handle to evaluate the monomials 1,lambda,lambda^2
%  and their derivatives.
%  This problem has the properties pep, qep, symmetric, sparse.
